Civic technologies are often lauded for their transformative potential to reduce the barrier between citizens and their government - creating government accountability through various modes of state transparency. Central to the value proposition of civic technology for transparency is the need for accurate, trustworthy, and timely release of government information. In this paper we review the evolution and growth of civic technologies that capitalize on three forms of government transparency:

1. Proactive Transparency, which includes open data initiatives to release machine-readable structured information to the public

2. Reactive Transparency, which includes responses to public records requests, and compliance with freedom of information laws

3. False Transparency, which includes civic technologies that expose gaps between state activities and public knowledge.

Through this review we highlight a number of ways in which the transformative potential of civic technologies is indeed being realized to great effect, as well the shortcomings of those efforts.


## Research Questions:

* What are the results of research into the creation and use of civic transparency technologies?

* How has research, development, or design practices within civic technology changed over the last decade? To what ends?

* Are there recorded governmental reaction in response to the use of civic transparency technologies? Why and How.


## Key Terms:
civic technology, engagement technology, civic engagement, voting technology, civic feedback, data access, open data, data leak, data transparency, open data, false transparency

## Key Definitions:
#### Civic Technology:
'Any technology that is used to empower citizens or help make government more accessible, efficient, and effective.' - Omidyar Network

'Technology used to deepen the democratic relationship between citizens and their state.' - Brookings

'Usually information technology, any technology that enables community, organization, or citizen engagement with public services; encouraging citizen communication, improving government infrastructure, generally improving the public good.' - Team, on generalized civic technology

'Usually information technology, any technology that not only enables a community, organization, or citizen engagement with public services, but additionally, may improve government infrastructure, provide transparent insight into process and outcomes, or allow self-selected participation.' - Team, on transparency technology

#### Transparency:
*Need to find and generate our own definitions for transparency*

*Open Government has a couple of definitions for transparency, ranging from data transparency, to participation transparency*

#### Voting:
'Traditional method in democracies for citizen input on a piece of legislation, an organization, or representative. Voting systems however can encompass multiple areas, voting systems in a mathematical and economic sense are how votes are counted, sorted, etc. In a civic technology sense, voting systems are the systems in place to record and store voting records to a level of transparency that all parties agree upon.'

*Needs work*

#### Resident Feedback:
'The process and outcome of citizens and constituents responding to public organizations and governments before, during, or after an event, change, item.'

#### Data Access:
'The idea and theory that some data should be publicly available, free to use, without restriction. The overarching idea of private and open data platforms and accessibility.'

*Rework either this or [Open Data](#open-data)*

#### Information Crowdsourcing:
'A sourcing model in which individuals and organizations use contributions from, usually internet, users to obtain needed services and ideas.'

#### Open Data:
'The idea and theory that some data should be publicly available, free to use, without restriction. The overarching idea of private and open data platforms and accessibility.'

*Rework either this or [Data Access](#data-access)*

#### Data Leak:
'A data leak, sometimes called, information leak, data breach, etc. is the intentional or unintentional release of secured, private information to an untrusted or public environment. In relation to Open Data, a data leak is government information that has been released to the public without original intention, usually released by an insider who believes fault in the system, or from an external government or insider individual who is actively working against the target government.'
