# Abstract

[Abstract Versions](abstract-versioning.md)

Over the last decade innovations in information communication technologies have had a transformative effect on interactions between citizens and their government - creating the potential for greater accountability and more meaningful engagement. But, ICTs have also been shaped by citizen demands for greater government transparency, and in particular access to information in readily usable, digital forms. Emerging 'civic technologies' for transparency therefore depend upon accurate, trustworthy, and timely release of government information. In the following paper we describe innovations in civic technologies that facilitate three forms of government transparency through information release: 1. Proactive Transparency, which includes open data initiatives to release machine-readable structured information to the public; 2. Reactive Transparency, which includes responses to public records requests, and compliance with freedom of information laws, and; 3. False Transparency, which includes civic technologies that expose gaps between state actions and actors, and their public discolosures. We conclude with a discussion of the potential futures for civic technologies to facilitate reasoned, accountable, and radical forms of transparency.  


## Research Questions:

In the following sections we seek to answer two specific research questions. 

* First, how have research, development, or design practices within civic technology changed over the last decade? What events, policies, technological innovations, or regime changes have influenced this evolution?

* Second, As civic technologies have matured, what forms of transparency do they facilitate? How do these forms of transparency support, or prohibit government accountability?

## Key Terms:
civic technology, engagement technology, civic engagement, voting technology, civic feedback, data access, open data, data leak, data transparency, open data, false transparency

## Key Definitions:
#### Civic Technology:
'Any technology that is used to empower citizens or help make government more accessible, efficient, and effective.' - Omidyar Network

'Technology used to deepen the democratic relationship between citizens and their state.' - Brookings

'Usually information technology, any technology that enables community, organization, or citizen engagement with public services; encouraging citizen communication, improving government infrastructure, generally improving the public good.' - Team, on generalized civic technology < ---- where did this come from?

'Usually information technology, any technology that not only enables a community, organization, or citizen engagement with public services, but additionally, may improve government infrastructure, provide transparent insight into process and outcomes, or allow self-selected participation.' - Team, on transparency technology < --- Where is this from? 

"the design and use of technology to support both formal and informal aspects of government and public services" (Boehner and DiSalvo, 2016) 

Civic technologies are occasionaly described in terms of affordances (Taylor et al. 2015), such that they offer new opprotunities for "ecologies of people, practices and data forms for generating, viewing and possibly analysing data in matters of civic concern" (Balestrini et al., 2017). 

We have to have more definitons. 

#### Transparency:
*Need to find and generate our own definitions for transparency*

*Open Government has a couple of definitions for transparency, ranging from data transparency, to participation transparency*

"...the doc- trine that the general conduct of executive government should be predictable and operate according to published (and as far as possible non-discretionary) rules rather than arbitrarily" (Hood 2006, 14).

Bauhr and Grimes suggest that a general defintion of transparency lacks measurable criteria, and therefore any operationalized study of transparency will be lacking. Instead, they suggest that government transparency can be measured along three principal dimmensions government openness, whistleblower protection, and likelihood of expsoure (or, more simply 'publicity') (Bauhr and Grimes, 2012). Although they caution against causal attribution, in a survey of public administration experts representing 52 countries, they demonstrate that these measures indicate "Countries rated as more transparent along the dimensions of access to information and publicity also tend to have less corruption, and to a greater extent honor other basic human rights and liberties."



#### Voting:
'Traditional method in democracies for citizen input on a piece of legislation, an organization, or representative. Voting systems however can encompass multiple areas, voting systems in a mathematical and economic sense are how votes are counted, sorted, etc. In a civic technology sense, voting systems are the systems in place to record and store voting records to a level of transparency that all parties agree upon.'

*Needs work*

#### Resident Feedback:
'The process and outcome of citizens and constituents responding to public organizations and governments before, during, or after an event, change, item.'

#### Data Access:
'The idea and theory that some data should be publicly available, free to use, without restriction. The overarching idea of private and open data platforms and accessibility.'

*Rework either this or [Open Data](#open-data)*

#### Information Crowdsourcing:
'A sourcing model in which individuals and organizations use contributions from, usually internet, users to obtain needed services and ideas.'

#### Open Data:
'The idea and theory that some data should be publicly available, free to use, without restriction. The overarching idea of private and open data platforms and accessibility.'

*Rework either this or [Data Access](#data-access)*

#### Data Leak:
'A data leak, sometimes called, information leak, data breach, etc. is the intentional or unintentional release of secured, private information to an untrusted or public environment. In relation to Open Data, a data leak is government information that has been released to the public without original intention, usually released by an insider who believes fault in the system, or from an external government or insider individual who is actively working against the target government.'
