## Rise In Civic Technology Creation
There are many sub-sectors of civic technology and with each comes a new definition of what civic technology encompasses.

While I can broadly define civic technology as 'any technology that serves to encourage communication and participation between public and private sectors for the public good.' There are many other definitions that focus on specific areas of civic technology.

It is important to mention the varying definitions and varying sectors of civic technology. Because while we are seeing growth all around the civic technology sector, we can identify very specific sectors that are outperforming others.

So regardless of how you choose to define civic technology, whatever scope you have, we are in the middle of a civic technology boom. As the Knight Foundation claims, for the past 12 years, civic technology has been growing consistently ~23% every 4 years.

There were an estimated 192 varying civic technology companies at the end of 2012. And from more recent studies, interest, conversation, action, affiliation and funding for civic technology companies has only continued to rise.

With the rapid expansion and development of civic technology as a product and service, we deem it valuable to study and review the effects it has on the public and government sectors. For our review, we will be focused in the data utility or data access sectors of civic technology which are often referred to as 'open data', 'open government', or 'e-governance'. These areas have seen incredible growth and support from both the governments and organizations they are targeted towards but also the citizens and constituents that utilize them, and we believe them to be incredibly valuable as tools to help change the way government allows for participation and transparency in their online interactions.

## Government Adoption of Information Technology
In the previous section, we discussed how civic technology companies are currently experiencing an era of rapid growth and development, and this is somewhat in part due to the governments adoption of information technology. Not to say that the federal government wasn't using information technology before, but rather that it wasn't until the Obama Administration push for more uses of information technology as platforms for sharing process and interaction with constituents.

To be fair, starting in the Clinton Administration, the push to include civic engagement in a digital form had begun. And the Bush Administration continued the trend, even while constantly under fire from press and citizens regarding their level of secrecy on many topics, both administrations took many great strides toward transparency through civic technology.

> 'Making information available online about meetings held between outside groups and the administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.'

> 'Invested significant resources and management efforts in creating the internet portal 'Regulations.gov', and then taking steps to use that portal to make available all federal agencies supporting materials for the new rulemaking proceedings.'

*(The Transparency President)*

While the Bush Administration's work towards digital and information technology engagement was admirable, then candidate Obama pushing in on the opacity the Bush Administration still kept, and campaigned on accountability and transparency through technology. In office, the Obama Administration reconstructed FOIA policies and created web portals for varying public organizations.

Through NGO's pushing for higher levels of transparency from all candidates, the call for 'streamlining the FOIA request process, and encouraging agencies to proactively release records using online document repositories' were heard loud and clear.

NGO's were pushing the federal government to make these changes, and in some ways they worked, but the ideas were also heard by local, city, and state organizations. Nearly all levels of government were encouraged to proactively publish data for citizens utilizing and adopting new information technology standards so that citizens could better understand the political and legislative processes occurring.

## Transparency as a Political Argument
As mentioned in the previous section, transparency and accountability have become two topics that are consistently brought up in political debates and proceedings starting with the candidates prior to the Obama Administration.

While he was campaigning, Obama believed:

> 'We must use all available technologies and methods to open up the federal government, creating a new level of transparency to change the way business is conducted in Washington, and giving Americans the chance to participate in government deliberations and decision making in ways that were not possible only a few years ago.'

At the time this was a platform that had never really been heard before. But was soon adopted by many candidates after seeing the success and reaction from constituents.

Candidates promising transparency through technology and data repositories has become commonplace. A strong reason this resonates with so many citizens is because it allows for journalists to sift through, understand, and create a well structured story for others to digest, while still allowing for individuals to double check the work independently and on their own accord.

This also enables development of other services like 'Change.org' that can be used by citizens to address and request accountability for the actions being seen in the stories and repositories.

In fact, this was such a strong sentiment, that roughly '80% of Americans view making the federal government more open and accountable to be an important priority.'

> 'By making more information available, the public can then participate more thoughtfully in the government process, sharing new information or raising questions about the adequacy of proposed governmental solutions.'

> 'Transparency can make abuse and mistake by government officials less likely, as those officials known that ordinary citizens, organized interest groups, the media, and other government officials can more easily monitor the workings of the federal government.'

*(The Transparency President)*

It is these sentiments that have created the transparency political argument. As we have seen in recent elections, and specifically the most recent presidential election, transparency was called for multiple times, from both major candidates. Transparency is now a large part of the political process. Citizens now have more access to information at all times than ever before and their ability to judge the data for themselves is at an all time high. Yet they are still requesting more data and transparency.

There are many types of transparencies produced by civic technology, from both public and private spaces, these technologies are what we claim have helped lead to citizens becoming more actively engaged with transparency and data utility. Whether it be indirect interaction with them or direct, the creation and utilization of these civic technologies should be thought of as a primary reason for the expansion of transparency and accountability as political arguments.

## Mistrust of Long Standing Entities
From above, when discussing indirect interaction with civic technologies, we have to understand what that means for the common citizen. While civic technologies focused on data utility are starting to expand and encourage a common user, the original use cases for many transparency technologies were aimed not for anyone but specifically journalists and media.

From a high level, the reasoning behind this is that there is just too much data to sift through, understand, and explain for a single person in their free time to handle. Instead, if you target journalists and news organizations as your primary user, the results are that you get a more streamlined method of developing public accountability stories.

However, what we have seen is that even though individuals can go and double check the work of the journalists, they haven't and in cases where the story goes against their own personal believes, they will start to lose trust in these long standing media organizations.

We can look to 'WikiLeaks' as the most famous of these civic transparency technologies to take on government accountability and transparency.

Even though WikiLeaks was created to encourage and explain inner government workings through data leaks and third party individuals releasing internal information to the public, citizens didn't respond in the way many, including WikiLeaks, predicted.

When WikiLeaks tried to produce a condensed, edited version of a group of documents, many believed they were trying to spin a story from nothing, and on other occasions when they didn't create these stories, no one did anything to double check a journalists sources as private individuals because the data was too hard to understand, the situation too complex to simply glance over the body of data.

This is the loss of trust we are talking about. While all of these transparency technologies are being developed, there still remains the question, how are they to be utilized in an effective manner that enables and builds trust between all parties using the service. Citizens having access to the data sets, without cost, without restriction has led to loss of trust of news organizations, but how will future transparency technologies encourage participation and cooperation between parties.

## Forward Thinking
The rapid growth and expansion of civic technology has led to questions regarding the future of government and public technologies.

- 'Who can best utilize these technologies?'
- 'What are the implications of this technology being created?'
- 'Where can we expand our current government infrastructure to allow more civic engagement?'
- 'Why are these technologies needed in the first place? Why are they being created as such a high rate?'
- 'How do these technologies, whether citizens use them, affect the processes of government or the outcomes for citizens?'
- etc. ...

As mentioned previously, the current trend in civic technology is a 23% growth every 4 years. And in regard to transparency technologies, how will this specific sector innovate from the WikiLeaks, publish and hope for change model. Will there be information and education design built into the civic technology platforms to help general users understand the data or documents they are viewing? Or will there be other systems yet unknown?

Will there still be a place for leak and hope for change model? In the current administration, leaks, large and small are occurring more and more frequently than before due to the ease of which data can be copied and transferred. Is the ideal transparency system one of radical transparency, or reasoned transparency?

Forward thinking can help begin the conversation to help understand these questions and have a better understanding how to best utilizes the many different models for civic transparency technologies.

## Modeling Transparency and Government Behavior
Lastly, we propose a framework for how to view civic transparency technologies. One which can be applied not only to the government institutions they target but also to the private organizations or individuals creating these technologies.

Creating a model for understanding the various types of transparency and the interactions that occur when using them allow for abstraction and better conceptual knowledge of how civic technologies have, and will continue to change the political landscape of the future.
