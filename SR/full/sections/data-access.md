# Data Access
Sometimes referred to as data utility, data access is the question and idea of how much data and information does a public institution share freely. And in short, there are four main ways for individuals to receive information from these organizations.

1. Public Information Release -- This is standard data access in a sense. This is a document library, a press release, an interview, or any other method of proactive information release from the organization. Public Information Release works best when the public institution releasing the information has reasoned transparency or truly radical transparency. If the information they are disclosing is believed valid by the public, then it would be reasonable to say that data access for a private citizen is high.

2. Information Crowdsourcing -- This is a growing area of data access and it relates to civic technology with how information and data spreads between groups outside of the public institution. We can use examples like Twitter, WikiLeaks, and other third-party content-storing services to demonstrate that it may not be the public institution that first releases a document library, but may be a group of organizations that combine together to work towards a shared mission of creating, researching, understanding, and expressing a story.

3. Open Data -- Much like Public Information Release, this can be a document library, but this excludes press releases, or interviews and more focused on the machine-readable versions of data. Data.gov, Recovery.gov, Data.Seattle.gov, are all examples of this type of data access, where as a whole, a document may not be an email, or a statement but an excel file for the city's budget and expenses. This is usually thought of as proactive radical transparency as these systems usually publish these datasets relatively quickly after they are created. Additionally, while a majority of Open Data as a topic is about positive data access, or increasing the availability of information in a given populace, data inaccessibility is just as important of a topic to cover. While Open Data initiatives are often created and deployed to fill the data inaccessibility gaps there are still residual areas that are known by the populace as having, storing, and creating data but are inaccessible to common citizens. This includes utilities , traffic, and environment data.

4. Data Leak -- Or Data Breach, Data Leak is the first-party or third-party leak of internal information or data to an outside organization. WikiLeaks was a large document library for data leaks from the federal government's State Department and Military services. With classification between leaks as well-intentioned and nefarious. Usually, these can be easily classified by if the leaker was an internal employee vs. an outside source.

Together, these can describe data access as a whole. It is not only the information that is available, but how that information and data was created, stored, and retrieved.
And while these four topics can generally cover all of data access as a subject matter, it is also important to note that many technologies, while not explicitly developed as civic technologies, have been utilized as civic engagement and awareness systems. Twitter for example is used as an information crowdsourcing tool by many news organizations and one could argue that Twitter is a civic technology, but it's original development was not aimed at specifically civic tech.

Civic transparency technology most commonly will focus heavily on one of these four areas and for our review we will focus on the latter three. Information Crowdsourcing, Open Data, and Data Leak. Whole industries have been built off of these sub-sectors of data access, whereas Public Information Release has largely been controlled by the public institutions themselves and largely doesn't need additionally help from third-parties.

**Should a section be written on Public Information Release and the lack of third-party technologies created?**
