# Data Access
Sometimes referred to as data utility, data access is the question and idea of how much data and information does a public institution share freely. And in short, there are four main ways for individuals to receive information from these organizations.

1. Public Information Release -- This is standard data access in a sense. This is a document library, a press release, an interview, or any other method of proactive information release from the organization. Public Information Release works best when the public institution releasing the information has reasoned transparency or truly radical transparency. If the information they are disclosing is believed valid by the public, then it would be reasonable to say that data access for a private citizen is high.

2. Information Crowdsourcing -- This is a growing area of data access and it relates to civic technology with how information and data spreads between groups outside of the public institution. We can use examples like Twitter, WikiLeaks, and other third-party content-storing services to demonstrate that it may not be the public institution that first releases a document library, but may be a group of organizations that combine together to work towards a shared mission of creating, researching, understanding, and expressing a story.

3. Open Data -- Much like Public Information Release, this can be a document library, but this excludes press releases, or interviews and more focused on the machine-readable versions of data. Data.gov, Recovery.gov, Data.Seattle.gov, are all examples of this type of data access, where as a whole, a document may not be an email, or a statement but an excel file for the city's budget and expenses. This is usually thought of as proactive radical transparency as these systems usually publish these datasets relatively quickly after they are created.

4. Data Leak -- Or Data Breach, Data Leak is the first-party or third-party leak of internal information or data to an outside organization. WikiLeaks was a large document library for data leaks from the federal government's State Department and Military services. With classification between leaks as well-intentioned and nefarious. Usually, these can be easily classified by if the leaker was an internal employee vs. an outside source.

Together, these can describe data access as a whole. It is not only the information that is available, but how that information and data was created, stored, and retrieved.

Civic transparency technology most commonly will focus heavily on one of these four areas and for our review we will focus on the latter three. Information Crowdsourcing, Open Data, and Data Leak. Whole industries have been built off of these sub-sectors of data access, whereas Public Information Release has largely been controlled by the public institutions themselves and largely doesn't need additionally help from third-parties.

**Should we just cut this section here and move on to their own subsections?**

**Should a section be written on Public Information Release and the lack of third-party technologies created?**
