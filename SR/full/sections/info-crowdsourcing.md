# Information Crowdsourcing
Information crowdsourcing, social media crowdsourcing, crowdsourced journalism. All of these areas are all relatively new and emerging topics of both study and civic technologies.

And there are even more crowdsourcing civic technologies that don't directly relate to transparency. There are community reporting platforms, services, and applications that let citizens send reports directly to a database for future processing and development. Applications like Seattle's: 'Find it Fix it' and Washington D.C.'s 'Open 311' are technologies built to allow third-party applications to directly report to government services. No longer do citizens have to call or find someone in a government office to schedule a visit or fix something in their neighbor street. They can simply use a third-party application built by someone in the community to report their issue.

At first this may not seem a whole lot like 'information crowdsourcing', and in some aspects it isn't what I would directly call information crowdsourcing. Usually, information crowdsourcing has to deal with news, events, journalism, in it's current definition that is. But these types of report generation technologies were the basis for what we now call information crowdsourcing technologies.

Without 'Open311', the idea that the government could receive reports from the community on such a scale, from anyone who wanted to submit one, was not thought out at all. 'Open 311' opened the door to new technologies specifically focused on journalistic, and transparency information crowdsourcing. Because once it was imaginable to collect bits of information from multiple individuals on a small scale, people thought of the implications of large scale tech.

The first real information crowdsourcing system wasn't a technology, but rather the effect the technology had on journalism. When WikiLeaks was first founded, the creators realized that the data present in many of the leaked documents was too complex and too large in scale for any one individual or one small journalism team to understand. So WikiLeaks partnered with multiple organizations, asking for their cooperation, giving each team parts of the leaks so they could build their own stories on that part of the data to then be combined with the other news organizations.

This was the first direct example of a civic technology, a civic transparency technology using information splitting and crowdsourcing to build a better picture and a better understanding of a situation.

And now, there are new varieties of the same 'document hosting service' like WikiLeaks once was. DocumentCloud is a new version tailored at journalists. The aim is to allow anyone to be able to upload any document and be able to be completely transparent about the document. In recent times we have seen this be used with the Trump Administration data leaks. And generally, journalists all share and use this service as they publish stories so that their work can be checked and ensured there is no bias.

In some aspects you can almost think of these systems as a transparency system for transparency technologies. If you are using a document hosting service like DocumentCloud or WikiLeaks to publish your material for fact-checking by others and collaboration, you are transparently building a story or article based off other transparency technologies that delivered you the leaks in the first place.

However this isn't the whole picture for information crowdsourcing. What was just described can be more thought of as a subsector of information crowdsourcing which would be 'journalistic crowdsourcing'. Another sector which spawned out of necessity was not created due to targeted development. That is to say, services like WikiLeaks and DocumentCloud were originally created with the idea that these services would be tailored to journalists and transparency technologies.

'Social information crowdsourcing', another subsector of information crowdsourcing was not directly developed, but utilized existing services and platforms. A key example to this was when the federal investigators of the Boston Bombing attacks of 2013 asked private citizens to submit all media, tips, and leads related to the attack. This lead to social media sites being utilized as public collaboration and submissions of tips and media. Reddit users would analyze images, Twitter users would submit tips, Facebook users would message friends and loved ones, asking for where-abouts, and if they had seen anything. This all resulted in the crowdsourced data in mere hours compared to normal investigative time. Enabling a 'modern manhunt', and resulted in one of the fastest responses to a terror threat in history.

Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, and Imgur are all services and platforms not originally intended for use as specifically civic technologies or crowdsourcing technologies, but this event revealed their true capabilities as such. And still today there are numerous journalists and events that take place and are recorded and published through these social media sites.

Transparency through crowdsourced technology showed true change in a matter of hours. Everyone could see updates to the investigation, and like many advocates for civic technology mention, it isn't just education of what is going on, but a call to action, and engagement availability that show the power that social media utilization as civic technology has. Transparency both of current events, but also, who was contributing. Journalists could for the first time easily receive and cite their information.

**Need to discuss how now there are checks in place to distinguish valuable data from poor data but still strong systems in place**
