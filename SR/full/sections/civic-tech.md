# Civic Technology
As more and more of the world becomes interconnected with various technology sources and information streams, governments have been faced with a tall order. Dated technology and slow to upgrade agencies have left the government with 'old procedures, processes and organizational forms... encoded in software. Requiring greater levels of bureaucracy to plan, implement, operate, and control them.' (Lathrop & Ruma)

Outdated technology isn't the only problem that existed when multiple government agencies tried to upgrade their systems and bring more information online. 'Many of these initiatives simply... focused on automating existing process and moving existing government services online.' (Lathrop & Ruma) And this is where the main problem lies and what civic technology fights back against.

Government technology has been set in the same methods and processes for ages. While technology has changed, no new innovation or adaptable, scalable, solutions have been brought into the public sector. The private sector and private citizens are free to innovate in their free time, and in the technology and web and online media markets innovation is fought for. Government systems however are afraid to fail. And for good reason.

What many of the definitions for 'civic technology' have in common is that they are produced by third party sources. Whether they are funded by investors or given resources from the government or simply free-time projects from interested developers, they are most commonly, third-party solutions to government problems.

Civic technology as a whole can be thought of as 'any innovation, usually in information technology, that has the opportunity to extensively change the way public and private entities interact.'

This is incredibly broad, and can include things like the Internet and the World Wide Web. While initially developed Tim Berners-Lee during his time at CERN, it has since grown to allow for incredibly powerful computation and information, storage, retrieval, and generation for all parties who want to use it.

The World Wide Web can be seen as a civic technology mainly due to it's 'openness'. By this I mean, and many others agree, 'openness', or the ability for anyone to utilize, understand, and interact with is what makes something a civic technology. This idea of being 'open by default' is an idea that was revolutionary at the time of the World Wide Web's creation but today is seen as standard in Internet regulations. Civic technology in this sense is forced to be broad; anything that is open and free for all to use is a civic technology.

However, while civic technology can encompass nearly all ranges of technologies. We also need specificity. In our case, we will be address civic transparency technologies.

My own personal definition: 'Usually information technology, any technology that enables community, organization, or citizen engagement with public services; encouraging citizen communication, improving government infrastructure, giving transparent insight into process, and generally improving the public good.'

Let me address the bulk of that definition and why each part pertains to transparency in some way or another.

'Encouraging citizen communication.' By transparency definitions, communication is key. Isn't that we always hear, 'more communication means higher levels or transparency' however I am not necessarily targeting this only at citizen to government or government to citizen but also citizen to citizen communication. Encouraging civic discussion and innovation is a large part of building government technology for transparency. If civic technology is to encourage transparency, it must also allow discussion and participation with the individuals in the process.

'Improving government infrastructure.' I will return to this topic later as this is a recurring theme in civic technology creation. Civic technologists usually build tech that tries to build on top of government systems, myself included. However those systems can only allow the same level of transparency as the systems they are built on top of. If the data coming into their own databases has been filtered, sorted, or in any way tampered, their own data is then also not as transparent as it should be. Not at their fault, but at the origin. And this is where infrastructure in civic technology is field that needs much more exploration. 'Government as a platform' is a common theme in the open government and open data venues, a radical change from how it is currently thought of as 'vending machine government.'

'Giving transparent insight into process.' Processes, knowing what is happening inside a public institution, or understanding how, or why something is happening is a constant request by many civic technologists. If a technology innovates and delivers a new method for explaining government processes and ensuring accountability in their method it should be rewarded and encouraged by the officials it targets.

And lastly, 'generally improving the public good.' The catch all. But again, I don't mean a catch all for all types of civic technology. In this case, a public for transparency would be a data repository, or a knowledge base, etc. There are many transparency technologies that focus exactly on that, storing, sorting, and filtering large sums of government information into more readable, digestible parts. WikiLeaks is a common example of a document library focused on transparency. And while the public opinion of it's motives and direction are questioned, it is undeniably a data repository for government leak and transparency documentation.

Throughout the rest of this review we will briefly discuss voting technologies and then dive deeper in to data utility technologies as they relate to transparency.
