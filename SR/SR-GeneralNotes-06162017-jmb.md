# Structure and Objectives Established

## SR Description
Providing an understanding of academia's research into applications, benefits, and more into open governments, open data, and e-democracy. Giving insight into what it means for an open government to have data leak. Providing context for topics surrounding false transparency.

## Reasoning of Topics
Below is a list and structure of topics I believe are important to cover as they relate to Data Leak in one way or another. From top-down, explaining what civic technology, the past, present, and future I feel is important due to the shift in how civic technology has been created, the purpose it was created for, and how we are now seeing it used and created for. Voting, not as a whole, but voting technologies, voting systems, the like. I believe the next step in voting technologies will be a secured election. That is, a system that guarantees your vote without mistake or tampering. This is more or less speculation from me, however we see rigged and tampered elections all across the world, and I feel it will be a large topic for open data and open government to research, and there is an obvious connection to a better voting system may be capable of proving falsified voting through open data and statistics. Resident feedback, one of the largest areas of civic technology and one of the few that has been rapidly built-out in this new push for civic technology. Civic action testing groups as we saw in Chicago and Open Seattle is pushing for, multiple city applications for citizen engagement, etc. The relation to data leak here is the systems for communication between resident and representative. There are now better systems in place for residents to give feedback and outrage after or during a leak. Peer-to-Peer local sharing, this is mainly focused around how residents share opinions and information with each other, I am interested in how leaks and the information contained in a leak is spread through peers as well as through news outlets. Data Access, this is the main overall topic that we will be discussing, data access is a relatively new topic in civic technology that relates to three main relevant sources, information crowdsourcing, open data, and data leak. Information crowdsourcing can be thought of as peer-to-peer data creation and dissemination. The two parts are important because in some cases you are spreading information before or after a data leak or utilizing open data, and data creation is a large part of what we are seeing plays a role in the modern day news cycle. Twitter and other citizen open platforms for spread of information have created ways for constituents to express emotion, and convey facts to each other without all being in the same place, also allowing for whole stories to break from these platforms. Open Data is why we are here, this is the information that governments deem to be safe for public use. A key way to phrase it. The data that they are openly published should not be thought of as transparent data, its cleaned, scrubbed, maintained data streams and sources. Data leak is the other main reason we are here, this is the unscrubbed, unsecured, unmaintained data that governments have a reason to hide from the public otherwise it would be published.

### Civic Technology
*Definition:* Usually information technology, any technology that enables community, organization, or citizen engagement with public services; encouraging citizen communication, improving government infrastructure, generally improving the public good.

*Examples include:* Code for America, Open Government Initiatives, MiVote

*Search Terms:* Civic Technology, Social Technology, Community Engagement Technology, Digital Civic Engagement, Digital Citizenship

*General Thoughts & Notes:* This is an introduction to what Civic Technology is, what it means, what it has produced, where it can expand, etc. Civic Technology as it stands today, has previously been thought of as communication and organization platforms to act as middle steps between representatives and citizens. Civic technology now, and as it is growing, can be thought of more as open governance. Whole systems of government can be improved or reimagined utilizing civic engagement. Example being Seattle's 'Find it, Fix it' mobile application, a very simple application to improve response times and better locate areas with high need for repair. Other examples include open data platforms for governments to publish data and citizen engagement services. The general shift, in my opinion is that in the past, what we saw was civic technology that focused on information dissemination from representatives to constituents, but now we are seeing technologies that focus on citizen empowerment. Even if a majority of the data published on an open data platform may be irrelevant, or the 'Find it, Fix it' application is used to make minor fixes, it still encourages citizens to utilize their own skills and have a better understanding of their local area without direct interaction with their representatives.

#### Voting
*Definition:* Traditional method in democracies for citizen input on a piece of legislation, an organization, or representative. Voting systems however can encompass multiple areas, voting systems in a mathematical and economic sense are how votes are counted, sorted, etc. In a civic technology sense, voting systems are the systems in place to record and store a voting record.

*Examples include:* Ballet, Punch card, FPTP, etc.

*Search Terms:* Voting Technology, Voting Systems, Open Voting

*General Thoughts & Notes:* This is an area that I feel I need to return to and add more context on after doing my brief research as I still feel there could be some good information on especially relating and relevant now after the most recent election this is an area where voting systems both economically and technology is being looked at for better methods in relation to open data and 'Open Voting'.

*Relevant Readings:* Digital Citizenship: The Internet, Society, and Participation; Helios: Web-based Open-Audit Voting

#### Resident Feedback
*Definition:* The process of and how citizens and constituents respond to governments before, during, or after an event, change, item.

*Examples include:* Petition (Change.org, etc), 'Find it, Fix it', etc.

*Search Terms:* Citizen Feedback, Public Deliberation, Social Engagement

*General Thoughts & Notes:* These are the systems that are on the rise now. Citizen engagement systems that allow for constituents to reach their representatives on multiple channels. While other systems also now allow for citizens to enact local change with minimal effort. These systems need to be studied because they allow for such rapid communication between parties and encourage citizen engagement after events occur, such as a data leak or policy change.

#### Peer-to-Peer Local Sharing
*Definition:*

*Examples include:*

*Search Terms:*

*General Thoughts & Notes:*

*Relevant Readings:*

#### Data Access
*Definition:* The idea and theory that some data should be publicly available, free to use, without restriction. The overarching idea of private and open data platforms and accessibility.

*Examples include:* Open Data Seattle, Open Data Initiative, etc.

*Search Terms:* Civic Open Data, Civic Data, Open Data, Public Data Access

*General Thoughts & Notes:* Because this is more of an overarching topic the encompasses the main three topics we are here to talk about, spend less time on this and just use it as a brief introduction to the three topics. The main theories behind open data, what has occurred in the field to see such prominence and push for open data.

*Relevant Readings:* Cyberdemocracy: Technology, Cities, and Civic Networks; E-Democracy: Thinking About the Impact of Technology on Civic Life

##### Information Crowdsourcing
*Definition:* A sourcing model in which individuals and organizations use contributions from, usually internet, users to obtain needed services and ideas. Additionally, this can be thought of as an extension of Peer-to-Peer Local Sharing except in a more digital medium.

*Examples include:* Twitter, Facebook, Social Media, WikiLeaks

*Search Terms:* Civic Crowdsourcing, Social Media Political Engagement, Civic Crowdsourcing Technology, Open Civic Engagement

*General Thoughts & Notes:* I hadn't really thought about this aspect of Open Data and Data Leaks, but from what I have encountered in my own experiences is that information crowdsourcing is becoming the go to way for leaks to occur and disseminate. Which means that this is a crucial area to study. Why are leaks starting here, why is this area more beneficial to use than others.

*Relevant Readings:* Cyberdemocracy: Technology, Cities, and Civic Networks; HCI, Civic Engagement & Trust

##### Open Data
*Definition:* The idea and theory that some data should be publicly available, free to use, without restriction. The overarching idea of private and open data platforms and accessibility. (Copied from Data Access, need to find better separation terminology)

*Examples include:* Open Data Seattle, Open Data Initiative, etc.

*Search Terms:* Open Data, Open Civic Technology, e-democracy, Digital Democracy, Open Government

*General Thoughts & Notes:*

*Relevant Readings:* Most everything I have linked

##### Data Leak
*Definition:* A data leak, sometimes called, information leak, data breach, etc. is the intentional or unintentional release of secured, private information to an untrusted or public environment. In relation to Open Data, a data leak is government information that has been released to the public without original intention, usually released by an insider who believes fault in the system, or from an external government or insider individual who is actively working against the target government.

*Examples include:* WikiLeaks, Media Leaks, etc.

*Search Terms:* Government Information Leak, Government False Transparency, Open Data Transparency, Government Data Security

*General Thoughts & Notes:* A lot to go over here as this will likely be the largest topic to cover. Previously talked to you about the sense of 'False Transparency' that open governments have now. I feel that we may need to split this topic into two main parts, well intentioned leaks and disruptive leaks. I say this because I feel that public response to the two separate events is vastly different.

Additionally, we need to discuss why leaks have become so prominent even with many democracies pushing for open data standards. Are we seeing more leaks occur because people have access to data that may be questionable and inquire further, or are we seeing leaks occur because insiders believe more data needs to be published.

Apart from this I believe we should look at how governments react after data leak, do they tend to try to tighten and secure their data more or do they publish their own versions of the data.
