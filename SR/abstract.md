#Abstract

Civic technologies are often lauded for their transformative potential to reduce the barrier between citizens and their government - creating government accountability through various modes of state transparency. Central to the value proposition of civic technology for transparency is the need for accurate, trustworthy, and timely release of government information. In this paper we review the evolution and growth of civic technologies that support three forms of government transparency: 1. Proactive Transparency, which includes open data initiatives to release machine-readable structured information to the public; 2. Reactive Transprency, which includes responses to public records requests, and complaicne with freedom of information laws; and, 3. False Transparency, which includes civic technologies that expose gaps between state activities and public knowledge. Through this review we highlight a number of ways in which the transformative potential of civic technologies is indeed being realized to great effect, as well the shortcomings of those efforts.

## Identify your research question:

Formulate a clear, well-defined research question of appropriate scope. Define your terminology. Find existing reviews on your topic to inform the development of your research question.

#### Motivating Research Questions:
* What are the results of research into the development and use of civic technology for transparency?

Terms to define:

Civic Technology:

"any technology that is used to empower citizens or help make government more accessible, efficient, and effective"

"One aspect of civic tech includes the use of technology by governments to deepen the democratic relationship between citizens and their state"


And, that this differs from Government Technology, how? :

Transparency:

Modes of transparency: Proactive, Reactive, and False.

* How has research, development, or design practices within civic technology changed over the last decade? To what ends?
