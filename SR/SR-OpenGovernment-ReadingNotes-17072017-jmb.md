current govtech: 'The result is that old procedures, processes and organizational forms were just encoded in software. Huge unwieldy mainframe beats not only cemented old ways of working, they required still greater levels of bureaucracy to plan, implement, operate, and control them.'

first wave e-government: 'many of these initiatives simply paved the cow paths--that is, they focused on automating existing processes and moving existing government services online.'

open government: 'the government that opens its doors to the world; co-innovates with everyone, especially citizens; shares resources that were previously closely guarded; harnesses the power of mass collaboration; drives transparency throughout its operations; and behaves not as an isolated department or jurisdiction, but as something new--a truly integrated and networked organization.'

                'it's the notion that the people have the right to access the documents and proceedings of government. the idea that the public has a right to scrutinize and participate in government dates at least to the enlightenment, and is enshrined in both the us declaration of independence and us constitution.'

                'has been influenced by the open source software movement, to allow for participation in the procedures of government.'

                'government where citizens not only have access to information, documents, and proceedings, but can also become participants in a meaningful way. improved communication and operations within the various branches and levels of government.'

gov 2.0: 'redefine the relationship between citizens and government officials. not about replacing representative democracy with some kind of online poll, but instead engaging the citizen as a full participant rather than an observer of their government.'

civic technology:
        web technology: 'creating an API to distribute information from its 311 system about city services to developers in a way that they can integrate and distribute that information into new software and web applications. everyone will be able to get information about citizen requests and issue new requests directly to city departments via their own web software. **this breaks the line between citizens and government--letting someone other than a government official determine how to route citizen requests.**'

                'we must use all available technologies and methods to open up the federal government, creating a new level of transparency to change the way business is conducted in Washington, and giving americans the chance to participate in government deliberations and decision making in ways that were not possible only a few years ago.' (obama)

                'the extraordinary power of open standards to foster innovation. when barriers to entry to a market are low, entrepreneurs are free to invent the future. when barriers are high, innovation moves elsewhere.' (16)

                'vibrant platforms become less generative over time, usually because the platform vendor has begun to compete with its developer ecosystem.' (16)

        external development is bad: issue -> ignored -> calamity event -> requirements and survey -> RFP (Request for Proposals) -> contract awarded -> solution delivered but only targets issues laid out in requirements and not holistic processes

                'its clear why the government is so far behind the times: it isn't allowed to solve its own problems, relying on people who do not understand them'

                'as long as the government keeps developers outside its walls, those developers have no hope of solving the government's technology problems.'

government modeling: 'vending machine government. we pay our taxes, we expect services. and when we don't get what we expect, our participation is limited to protest--essentially, shaking the vending machine.' (kettl)

                'like apple's app store marketplace, how does government become an open platform that allows people inside and outside government to innovate? how do you design a system in which all of the outcomes arent specified beforehand, but instead evolve through interactions between government and its citizens, as a service provider enabling its user community' (13-14)

                'a great platform provider does things that are ahead of the curve and that take time for the market to catch up to. it's essential to prime the pump by showing what can be done.' (36)

transparency: 'the word transparency can lead us astray as we think about the opportunity for gov 2.0. yes, it's a goodthing when government data is available fso that journalists and watchdog groups like the sunlight foundation can disclose cost overruns in government projects or highlight the influence of lobbyists. But that's just the beginning. **the magic of open data is that the same openness that enables transparency also enables innovation, as developers build applications that reuse government data in unexpected ways.**' (25)

                in relation to civic tech: 'build your own (government) websites and applications using the same open systems for accessing the underlying data as they make available to the public at large' (38)

                in relation to verifiability: 'once third parties become primary interfaces for crucial government information, people will inevitably ask whether some of the sites that provide data in innovative ways are distorting the data. slight alterations to the data could carry major policy implications, and could be hard for citizens to detect. to lower the barrier for building trustworthy third-party sites, government should provide authentication for all published bulk data sets so that anoyone who encounters the data can verify its authenticity' (87)

                'government should sign entire data sets, which will allow any downloader to check that the 'signed' data set was published by the government and not altered in transit.' (87)

participation: 'true engagement with citizens in the business of government, and actual collaboration with citizens in the design of government programs.' (25)

                'applications and APIs that allow citizens to actually replace functions of government, in self-service analogue to Craigslist.' (26) --> think find it fix it

                'imagine government using a platform like Meetup to support citizens in self-organizing to take on major projects that the government would otherwise leave undone.'(26)

                'people do not have to participate in the same exercise. one person may want to work on Peer-to-Patent, another may want to get involved in health card debates. One person may want to work on energy policy, another may want to organize a corps of energy 'scouts' to go door-to-door and help neighbors evaluate their energy usage. **the ability to self-select to participate in the arena of one's choosing is what makes collaborative democracy egalitarian.**' (65)

data access: 'if a document is to have the force of law, it must be available for all to read. artificial restrictions on access are not appropriate for the law of the land. if a meeting that is part of the law-making process is to be truly public, it must be recorded and documented to be put online. legal materials should be available to all.' (46)

                APIs: apis are usually constrictive in their searching and returning of data. from the api builders perspective, certain information may not be useful, and therefor doesnt return it from the the api request. other situations regarding targetted information fail at specificity, or how data is read and returned. if a person wants only data on a certain location but can only give city instead of zip code as their preferred data location, the api isnt built out to allow for generality. (88)
