## Open Government
[Link to Book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596804367.do)

With each chapter topics become more and more developed. However there are a few major ideas already clearly defined by multiple chapters.

Current government technology was built to handle old procedures, processes or organizations that were never updated because the software developed was built on top of them and they don't want to change. This results in government slowdown and bureaucracy.

This problem could be solved by the implementation of multiple systems, first of which is a government as a platform model. Current consensus is that we have a 'vending machine' government, where you put money in (taxes) and expect services or goods in return. However if you changed the way government interacted with the public and utilized it as a data platform to share and incorporate multiple systems together you could not only build better technology that addresses multiple issues, but also encourage this behavior.

Code for America, Data.gov, hackathons, etc. all of these are focused civic tech projects that have the support from government but just need more resources and better access to data from the government to create more intricate and stronger applications and software for not just the public but for government as well.

Open government as an idea, defined loosely by multiple parties in the novel is the notion that people have the right to access the documents and proceedings of government. The idea, that the public has a right to scrutinize and participate in government. This idea also incorporates open source software ideals to believe that self-selected participation to develop and create projects for the public good produces the best products.

Civic technology as an idea can range from anything that touches the public interface in anyway to a tailored focused project on one aspect of civic life. One of the larger ideas from Open Government was that, government as a platform allows for the interaction between application and government instead of government to application only. The allowance for developers to create systems that replace functions of government breaks the line between citizens and government. Let someone other than a government official determine how to route a citizen request or movement.

Transparency: not only does open data increase transparency by being a radical idea, it allows for innovation. Developers will build applications that reuse government in unexpected ways.

## The Transparency President
[Link to Paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01451.x/abstract)

As a major part of his campaign, President Obama promised an unprecedented openness throughout government operations. Utilizing transparency and accountability as political arguments and capitalizing on Bush era opacity on many issues. Obama pushed for 'fishbowl' or as we are calling it, 'radical', transparency in the short term but his campaigning and rhetoric raised unrealistic expectations and backfired when demands from civic transparency advocates pressured for much more than his administration gave.

Transparency at a certain point can be a detriment. Example being, when it hinders internal deliberation and undermines privacy. And due to this, the question was asked: how much and what type of transparency is best. The Obama Administration ultimately placed limits on transparency and continued to do so throughout it's term.

A major theme in this piece is that information technology constantly brings new avenues of possible transparency due to data generation from utilization. Every year, more data and documents are created.

Produce low level radical transparency systems to distract from the lack of reasoned transparency systems.

- [Trends in Civic Tech](https://www.slideshare.net/knightfoundation/knight-civictech)

We are seeing massive growth of civic technology companies. For multiple reasons, but generally can be attributed to interest but also more data access and information technology incorporation into government systems. Open data initiatives open up completely new areas for cooperation and innovation both from government and private civic technology companies.

Whole new areas of transparency technologies are being developed due to this idea of information crowdsourcing. Companies like DocumentCloud, which not necessarily created with civic technology in mind, have been coopted by journalists to share information and data with the public and each other to have better understand of all the data present in a story before publishing.

Additionally, new information crowdsourcing technologies are being developed due to mainstream journalism taking to long to react to breaking news in a timely manner. It is important to note that while information may turn out to be false, in our modern time, citizen generated news aggregation is an idea to help citizens better understand what is happening in their local area that they may understand quicker and more thoroughly than journalists from outside their area.

Projects are being created to help not only journalists identify 'fake news', but to also understand where it is coming from and what it means. Misinformation is a combative force against transparency in many aspects and therefore these projects that aim to shine light on 'fake news' should be seen as transparency technologies as well.

## WikiLeaks: Illusion of Transparency
[Link to Paper](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0020852311429428)

For the US Military and the State Department, 2010 was a rather strenuous year. Combatting numerous, massive (read: largest in history) leaks multiple times in the same year was no easy feat.

With information technology being the commonplace method of creating, storing, and sharing information, data, and documents, it is becoming easier to copy thousands of files at a time and then for subsequent leaks to occur. WikiLeaks can be seen as the first large service to deliver a service to release these information leaks to the internet. Claiming to be a bastion of transparency for the good of the public.

However WikiLeaks, was a prime example of how radical transparency isn't always the best solution and in many ways, may not have the desired effect but in fact a negative outcome. 'Leak, publish, and wait' can be defeated.

WikiLeaks didn't bring a new era of transparency, it brought an illusion of transparency. If anything, it showed the obstacles to attain higher transparency even in the information age.

Additionally, there is this idea of 'economic censorship,' that even if transparency is brought about by a third-party civic technology, the government showed that they can shut down these services by targeting their partners.

WikiLeaks also showed, a key idea of radical transparency and why it may not work in practice. Private citizens who have political opinions on a topic may not believe the journalists delivering the information to them and thus, blame the transparency technology and not look into the data themselves because the data is too hard to understand.

## Helios Voting
[Link to Paper](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec08/tech/full_papers/adida/adida.pdf)

Voting is the primary tool for civic engagement and with information technology now being readily available and utilized by nearly all citizens, internet based encrypted voting has become a topic of discussion by many experts.

Helios is a voting system built on top of block-chain technology. While there isn't a need to dive into the specifics of how block-chain works, in short block-chain allows for a full ledger of activity on a network and thus being utilized by a voting system would allow for detection of fraud or misuse of the voting system itself.

Helios brings a new layer to voting with block-chain and allows for encrypted transparent voting. It is still possible to see real-time voting counts and detect fraud but voters remain private and thus solves a lot of the issues surrounding voter privacy.

However there are issues with moving Helios to a large scale voting test as well as no verifiable way to check for coercion. This is a product that is meant to show how powerful an open audit and completely transparency voting technology could look like.

## Governing The Smart City
[Link to Paper](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0020852314564308)

Smart cities and their governance have amassed much confusion from academia in recent times in determining how to characterize and define them.

Current works, fight over a smart city should be defined by either the technologies it utilizes or the social structure of the city itself. Additionally, many publications focus on the transformation of governance through new technologies but lack detail on the conservation of current systems. Many civic technology projects are great at innovating, but many civic technology projects are only citizen facing. Does this mean that it's a new system or an innovation over an old system?

Many publications push a 'smart cities make life better for everyone' sentiment, but there hasn't been much research into the political choices of smart city technical choice.

E-government is a union of not just innovative technology but of the culture and social structure of a city. Therefore, do not forget to only focus on the technology but how the public, and government reacts to technology creation and utilization.

## Internet Voting Technologies
[Link to Paper](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13183222.2004.11008847)

Like with Helios, it is important to note that voting is the primary method of civic engagement for the general public. E-voting as a topic brings about ideas of large scale, direct democracy, relatively quick, and incredibly cheap.

However, throughout their investigations and discussions, the consensus wasn't that direct democracy would necessarily benefit from e-voting as the general thought was that e-voting would increase voter turnout.

The direct benefits of e-voting are instead cost and time. The future of voting is that at some point, e-voting and voting technologies will innovate, but only because they bring great cost and time benefits not because they increase voter turnout.

Voter trust is also a topic to consider when discussing e-voting as while many people have access to the internet, there is still a large percent that doesn't understand the technology and may not trust the new systems. In short, this could mobilize younger voters while turning away senior voters.

Additionally, digital divide is a topic worth consideration as, when credit cards were introduced, they like e-voting should be, were allowed to be interchangeable with checks, now-a-days, credit cards are completely dominant over checks. Does this suggest that e-voting will someday over take current voting methods even if both are allowed?

The article ends on an interesting idea that e-voting and e-governance may just be political tools to economize on government expenditures rather than extending democracy.

## E-Democracy: The Impact of Technology on Civic Life
[Link to Paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ncr.89305/abstract)

As technology continues to have an ever-increasing pace of innovation, discovery, and creation, we are presented with new means of communication and collaboration. In politics, we have seen new ways to conduct campaigns and elections, governance from officials, and participation from citizens.

As a whole this article focuses on one main concept: broadening of technological idealism in relation to civic life. When civic technology only addresses a singular part of an individuals life, it has minimal impact on society, but e-voting, and other more large-scale civic technology projects will have wide spread and drastic changes to our civic life.

E-Democracy as a whole needs to emerge as a public space on the Internet. It will take time to innovate and create a solution for positive, social good, discourse amongst individuals, but this is the direction we are already headed, so best to be aware of the potential growing pains we will experience as we shift towards online technologies.

## HCI: Civic Engagement and Trust
[Link to Paper](http://delivery.acm.org.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/10.1145/2710000/2702255/p2833-harding.pdf?ip=128.95.104.66&id=2702255&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=B63ACEF81C6334F5%2EF43F328D6C8418D0%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&CFID=968642334&CFTOKEN=62420307&__acm__=1501880599_1dad936ed2873210e544d255a50d2aef)

While there is rapid innovation and development of civic technology meant to bridge the divide and disconnect between citizens and officials, designing these systems is in a poor spot. Civic engagement technologies continue to have low usage levels primarily due to system developers lacking the understanding civic technology creation isn't just about empowering citizens but also receiving support from city and government officials.

Developers cannot focus on only one audience of the civic technology. How the technology interacts with all invested parties is key to its success. Not only does it need the support of the citizens, it needs the trust of the government that it will be beneficial to use.

With many technologies encouraging 'social detachment' and 'disengagement', civic technology needs to foster the opposite feelings. Civic technology needs to be designed to support communities and encourage communities to support each other. Participatory design with all entities would be a strong step forward for design solutions for civic problems.

## WikiLeaks and the Age of Transparency
[Link to Paper](http://www-tandfonline-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/doi/abs/10.1080/10357718.2012.681991)

WikiLeaks created a drastic shift in how communication occurs due to increase in transparency and connectivity. Information gathering and dissemination have ceased to be top-down process but rather bottom-up and in some cases, they are no longer bottom-up either, no have two way dissemination avenues.

WikiLeaks was not a cause of 'the age of transparency' but rather a symptom.

> This would follow the Knight Foundation's take on DocumentCloud and other information crowdsourcing platforms being created.

WikiLeaks and other such networks exist because the knowledge of how to build and maintain such networks is now widespread and mainstream. They only encouraged higher levels of transparency from advocates rather than creating higher levels of transparency.

## Blacked Out
[Link to Review](http://www-tandfonline-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/doi/abs/10.1080/13876980802468972)

> 'Democracy is Transparency with Accountability to the People'

Government secrecy is common with all governments. Blacked Out addresses not only US government secrecy but also fraud and corruption in other countries that is being combated by transparency organizations and accountability groups.

The concept of FOIA was revolutionary at the time of creation but has since been called into question, asking: "is this enough?"

The author notes that while during wartime (specifically: war on terrorism) requires greater secrecy in order to pursue and prosecute terrorists and their supporters, the US government secrecy pre-dates the terrorist attacks of 9/11.

The author points out that FOIA is a democratic process. Depending on the current administration, FOIA may be stronger or more transparent than a previous administration, however usually, the strongest 'maelstroms of transparency' are leaks, which grow ever larger with the increased usage and dependency on information technology.

In summation: the author sees the need for some restraint in transparency. However, he argues that government decision making is becoming more and more limited and closed from the public, even when technology is only encouraging more transparency.
