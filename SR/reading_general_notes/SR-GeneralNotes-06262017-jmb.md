## The Transparency President? The Obama Administration and Open Government

#### The Push for Open Governance
The Obama Administration had the benefit of coming off of the Bush Administration, which was seen by 'many observers... operat[ing] too much in the dark, begetting a general mistrust of the administration's motives and actions.'

The Bush Administration help a high level of secrecy surrounding its unpopular military and foreign affairs, however complaints also came in about secrecy in regards to domestic policy.

Candidate Obama: 'Create a transparent and connected democracy' (Obama 2007)

Obama believed in transparency and pushed for transparency, but it wasn't a question of should something be transparent or not.

But rather 'how much transparency, and what type, to have over different aspects of the governmental process.'

'Good, open government is not the same as a reality television show that broadcasts every move officials make and every conversation they have. On the contrary, good government actually requires certain limits on this kind of fishbowl transparency.'

While the Bush administration held a high level of secrecy about numerous topics, it also took great strides toward transparency than did previous administrations.

   - 'Making information available online about meetings held between outside groups and the administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.'
   - 'Invested significant resources and management effort in creating the Internet portal Regulations.gov, and then taking steps to use that portal to make available all federal agencies' supporting materials for the new rulemaking proceedings.'

Regardless of these improvements to government transparency, the Bush Administration would go down as the 'secrecy presidency.' Thus the next president, democrat or republican, would be able to create a new course for government transparency.

#### Transition

In 2007, many candidates were pushing for more transparent government and many projects and groups started advocacy for government transparency. [OMB Watch](#Transition "An Open Government Advocacy Group"), was focused on transparency and public participation. In 2008 they released nonpartisan recommendations. One of the largest recommendations was streamlining the FOIA request process, and encouraging agencies to **PROACTIVELY** release records using online document repositories.

Unlike the previous administration, memos and letters urged the Obama administration to take more positive responses to FOIA requests. Additionally, pleading for more steps to be taken to improve public access by better use of information technology.

On his first day, Obama signed three presidential memos, two of which directly addressed open government. One of which, directed the attorney general to develop a new FOIA policy that would clearly establish a presumption in favor of the release of government information.

   - FOIA REQUEST UPDATE: DOJ will only defend FOIA denials when disclosure was prohibited by law or when an agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by one of the statutory exemptions.

'In the face of doubt, openness prevails.' (Obama 2009)
'Government should not keep information confidential merely because public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure, because errors and failures might be revealed, or because of speculative or abstract fears.' (Obama 2009)

Additionally, two executive orders were signed, the first revoked a Bush executive order that enabled former presidents to limit public access to their official documents.

In February 2009, President Obama announced the creation of a new website, Recovery.gov, which was intended to insure 'that every American can find out how and where their money is being spent' (Obama 2009)

Mid-march, issued a presidential memorandum banning conversations between government officials and lobbyists over economic stimulus funds and requiring Internet-based disclosure of written communications.

Pushing for proactive publishing to reduce the number of FOIA requests received.

#### The Good and Bad of Open Government
'80% of Americans view making the federal government more open and accountable to be an important priority'

Good: 'By making more information available, the public can then participate more thoughtfully in the governmental process, sharing new information or raising questions about the adequacy of proposed governmental solutions.' (Stiglitz 2003)

Good: 'Transparency can make abused and mistakes by government officials less likely, as those officials know that ordinary citizens, organized interest groups, the media, and other government officials can more easily monitor the workings of the federal government.' (C, K, M 2009)

Bad: Total transparency can limit probing and self-critical forms of deliberation because they know that outsiders could be monitoring everything they say and do.

Bad: Total transparency could make it less likely that government officials would gain useful information from private actors.

#### Fishbowl transparency:
'expand the release of information that can document how government officials actually behave, such as by disclosing meetings held between White House staff and outside groups.'

#### Reasoned transparency:
'government officials offer explicit explanations for their actions.'


**IMPORTANT: 'Modern information technology may give us more noise, when what we really need is better music.' We need more reasoned transparency, communication between agency and citizen to explain and engage.**

**Sidenote: is it really the governments job to clear the noise? In some context I feel that there should be an emphasis on citizen engagement and reaction to fishbowl transparency, and ask for reasoned transparency**

#### Effects of Transparency
There are diminishing returns to levels of transparency a government takes. An incredibly secretive government moving to a moderately open government system will have great effects on governance, but an open government moving more towards total transparency might not have the same effect.

Long term effects however were hard to see as more and more controversial FOIA requests came through. A notable case from the ACLU fighting for information regarding the treatment of detainees. After initial indication that he would support the release of information, he later backpedaled and denied the ACLU's FOIA request. The pledge for transparency and accountability is rendered meaningless.

Recovery.gov, which was supposed to be a bastion of federal tracking, was left in the dust and only to post press releases and summarizations of spending and not the individual breakdowns promised.

From the looks of it, transparency was either used as a political point system or he could not live up the rhetoric he had used during campaigning. He had to make difficult trade-offs however, from the Bush Administration was there really much more improvement in government transparency?

### The Transparency President, TL;DR:
The Obama Administration had a leg up on claiming to be the transparency president due to the Bush Administration's private dealings. However, both administrations created systems that enabled transparency just a bit more. Obama however had campaigned on open government and could not quite live up to his rhetoric. Both administrations, faced scrutiny regarding certain FOIA requests and general opacity of their respective administration's dealings.

The main goal, regardless of administration, in my opinion, was to produce low-level fishbowl transparency systems to distract from the lack of reasoned transparency systems.

And maybe that is what this is about, total transparency and reasoned transparency. Do we need more information or do we need more explainations.

## WikiLeaks: The Illusion of transparency
WikiLeak's aim is to challenge 'increasing authoritarian tendencies' in government and the growth of unaccountable corporate power. (WikiLeaks 2011)

In 2010, WikiLeaks released classified video showing an attack by U.S. Army helicopters in the streets of Baghdad in 2007 that killed twelve people, including two journalists with the Reuters news agency. Later that year, it released 90,000 documents describing US military operations in Afghanistan from 2004 to 2010. Later again, almost 400,000 documents detailing US military operations in Iraq were released.

By the end of 2010, WikiLeaks and Assange had become the center of a vast media spectacle.

'The scale and significance of the leaks, and the rapidity with which one followed another, led many observers to conclude that the world was moving into a new era of supercharged or 'radical transparency'

'Like him or not, [Assange] now has the power to impose his judgement of what should or shouldn't be secret'

The scale at which leaks occur now-a-days is much higher simply because of how easy it is to copy thousands of documents. However the real truth behind WikiLeaks, is how radical transparency can be defeated.

The system of 'leak, publish, and wait for the inevitable outrage' doesn't always work in practice.

However, how do you measure a leak? Size, significance? The way of measuring the significance of a leak is misguided, because if you 'possess a very large number of records, you must also only have a fraction of the total number of records that are stored behind the wall of secrecy.'

The size and volume of data created by federal agencies is growing vastly each year, so if you want to measure significance by percent documents revealed versus total documents, the equation is hard to solve as the denominator is always increasing.

Additionally, most leaks contain a large amount of information that isn't classified as secret.

#### The Challenges of Digital Leaks
The reality of storing and publishing these leaks hit hard after the release of State Department cables in late 2010. On December 1, AWS, stopped hosting WikiLeaks material, alleging that WikiLeaks had violated Amazon's ToS by distributing material which it did not own. Additionally, Tableau stopped allowing and providing online graphics for WikiLeaks, the same day. The following day the firm that managed the domain name for WikiLeak's discontinued service. And on December 20, Apple removed an application from its store that allowed access to the State Department cables. PayPal stopped processing donations to WikiLeaks on December 3. MasterCard stopped processing payments to WikiLeaks on December 6. December 7, Visa stopped payments as well.

This all happened within a month of publishing the State Department cables. And more specifically complicated WikiLeaks' ability to distribute leaked information.

The leaks, had produced a rage in Washington D.C. and many believed these companies acted out of political pressure, which isn't hard to believe considering Joe Liebermann, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, publicly encouraged business to stop providing services. Querying directly with Amazon, and Tableau later conceded that it acted in response to Lieberman's request. PayPal denied that it had been in contact with any government official but acknowledged that its decision was taken after State Department said that WikiLeaks documents might have been obtained illegally.

**Note: This was happening during the Obama Administration's push for transparency**

**Assange called it: 'economic censorship'**

A second, just as large difficulty is the task of organizing, interpreting, and drawing attention to information. The radical view assumes that these tasks are straightforward. Information is received; it is posted online; and it readily finds an audience, which in turn easily makes send of it.

In practice however, this was not the case for WikiLeaks.
How do you manage such a large mass of digitized information?

It was assumed that WikiLeaks had to step up hosting the Iraq War logs on AWS servers because WikiLeaks own internal infrastructure was not capable of handling the data.

Additionally, given the complexity of a leak, it sometimes won't matter or people won't care because they don't understand the material. (Domscheit-Berg 2011)

**'WikiLeaks release of information is unprecedented: but it is not journalism. The data needs to be interpreted, studied, made into a story.'**

Assange attempted this with the US Helicopter strike and stated that 'we will try and get the maximum possible political impact for the material that they give to us.'

Due to Assange and team editing the video to try and show the significance of the event, many people turned on WikiLeaks and felt they had manipulated the video to bolster its allegations of military misconduct.

**'WikiLeaks recognized the need for a harm minimization plan but lacked the field knowledge necessary to make good decisions about redaction.'**

To combat this, WikiLeaks partnered with The New York Times, the Guardian, Der Spiegel, Le Monde, and El Pais.

However what WikiLeaks and the news agencies saw wasn't an information leak problem, but a project on data interpretation.

WikiLeaks shifted from receiver and distributer of leaks to now receiving and working with mainstream media to decide how, or if, leaked information ought to be published.

**'The outflow of leaked information was constrained by the newspapers judgement of its newsworthiness, and their willingness to invest money and time in the task of processing more records.'**

#### Outrage
'WikiLeaks would 'rely' upon the power of overt fact to enable and empower citizens to bring feared and corrupt government and corporations to justice.'

However with each leak and specifically the State Department Cables, the Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, there was a drastic overestimation regarding the willingness of the American public to respond to disclosures with the required level of outrage to enact policy change.

'If the leaks had been narrower in scope, and targeted toward the revelation of specific abuses, Americans might have viewed them more positively. But the leaks were large and indiscriminate, and **WikiLeaks appeared to suggest that its aim was as much to upset the existing order as to correct specific injustices.**'

#### Government Response
The movement for transparency is a game that is played repeatedly. In one iteration, activists use some new tool, a new law, technology, or social mobilization, to share governmental information, in the next iteration, politicians and bureaucrats respond to this new level of exposure by restricting laws or policies, changing their own use of technology or adapting administrative procedures.

Even with an administration that was going to usher in a new era of open government, the restrictions and fight given was too much for WikiLeaks.

**'At the same time, US federal agencies responded to the leaks by tightening administrative controls on access to sensitive information'**

'The leaks themselves have reduced the probability that a perfect storm will reoccur.'

The governments response to the military leaks in 2010 were not limited to military organizations, but the OMB ordered all federal agencies to review their procedures for safeguarding classified information.

Additionally, fallout management teams were formed after the State Department cables incident.

**'Even if government officials have lost control of the information itself, the have not lost their capacity to shape the way it was interpreted.'**

### WikiLeaks, TL;DR:
During the Obama Administration we saw the rise and fall of the document collection and distribution point WikiLeaks. It faced numerous problems that are vastly complex in their own right but can be summarized in four main points.

1. Size and significance of a leak cannot fully be determined.
2. Comprehension and organization of information is an ever-growing task.
3. Data leakage is a cyclical game, with one party always trying to grow and the other trying to patch.
4. Governments are not passive participants.

Finally, it is important to note, that for a data leak to be successful, the leaking organization(s) must be able to tell a story, while also maintaining a level of openness with how they edited/ changed/ used the information. What was seen was that with many of the leaks, while they had valuable information, there was too much to digest and people didn't trust edited versions of the story.
