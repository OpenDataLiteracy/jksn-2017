# Prep for Meeting:

### Questions for Counsel:
- What are the current systems/ processes in place when handling LegiStar?
- What do you believe the primary function of the LegiStar system is?
- What issues do you have with the current system?
- If you could have an ideal system what would it look like?
- Do you have data on who uses the current system?
- Do you imagine a remake of the LegiStar system or a complete separate tool?

### Own Notes:
From my perspective, I believe the best way for outside users to understand a system as complex as legislation is, is to see a process flow.

However obviously that only covers certain tasks within the arena of legislation. Tasks pertaining to simple discovery don't need a process flow but simply relevant information.

My biggest gripe with the system is that you have specificity in regards to what you are looking for, but many, I would argue a majority of the public doesn't know exactly what they are looking for.

In comparison to the system I am building with the state data, I believe a more structured tracking system should be put in place. Tracking meetings, full text of a bill, etc. I know the LegiStar system already encompasses this, but gaining access to it/ targeting the wrong data is punishing.

### Comments:
Outside stakeholders:
- press and news organizations
   - We want to give them access to the data and let them explain it. We don't have the bandwidth to handle both.
- social service organizations
   - non-profit legislation sponsors, etc.

### User Cases:
Apartment Tenant: As an apartment tenant, I want to be able to view my rights so that I can better understand language in a contract or a ongoing situation between my landlord and myself.

Civic Engagement: As an individual who cares about public greenspaces in the city, I want to be able to view past and upcoming meetings regarding civic greenspace so that I can both have a better understanding of what is currently planned and when I can come to a counsel meeting to ask questions and voice concern.

Data Journalist: As a data journalist, want to be able to track and analyze language used in city counsel meetings, so that I can create prediction models for upcoming legislation or counsel discourse.

NGO: As a member of an NGO, I want to be able to view the direct language of proposed legislation to city counsel for internal review and planning of our organization.
