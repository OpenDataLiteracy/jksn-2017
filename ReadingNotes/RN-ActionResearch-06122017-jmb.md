#### Overview
Similar to Participatory Design practices, Action Research is centered around *immediate or reflective process of progressive problem solving*. Action Research involves participating in a [change situation](#change-situation) often via and existing organization, whilst simultaneously conducting research. Action research is often aimed at improving their strategies, practices, and knowledge of the environments within their practice.

'Action research is an interactive inquiry process that balances problem solving actions implemented in a collaborative context with data-driven collaborative analysis or research to understand underlying causes enabling future predictions about personal and organizational change.'

Action research challenges traditional social science by moving beyond reflective knowledge created by outside experts sampling variables, to an active moment-to-moment theorizing, data collecting and inquiry occurring in the midst of emergent structure. In a sense, performing action research is that same as performing an experiment.

#### Theories
Chris Argyris' action science begins with the study of how human beings design their actions in difficult situations. Humans design their actions to achieve intended consequences and are governed by a set of environment variables. This framework is different from experimental research which control environmental variability.

Cooperative inquiry creates a research cycle among four different types of knowledge.
1. Propositional, contemporary science
2. Practical, knowledge of actually doing
3. Experiential, real-time feedback from interaction
4. Presentational, rehearsal through new practices

Participatory Action Research is a significant methodology for intervention, development and change within groups and communities. It a response to the traditional formal models of education where a 'teacher' stands at the front and 'imparts' information to the 'students' who are passive participants. PAR, demands interaction with participants and leader to drive innovation.

#### Applications
Organization development and action research have gone hand-in-hand and work well together. One such example can be found in ['Bringing Perspective to the Change Situation'](http://www.ascd.org/ASCD/pdf/journals/ed_lead/el_197001_mangione.pdf) which is detailed in [additional reading 1](#change-situation). This was action research being applied to a change situation in an education setting.

#### Action Research
Action research (AR) is about action and, at the same time, it is also rigorous research. When applied in the context of technology, Action research is the study of how technology is applied in the real world and the practical consequences of technology-enabled action.

Typically, the researcher tried to provide a service to a 'client', often an organization, and at the same time add to the body of knowledge in a particular domain. The emphasis for study may be on technology design, empirical evaluation of the effects of one or more technologies, or both.

      Civic technology, and modern web technologies are disruptive, 'how can we disrupt the market and have our break out product shine?' But how can civic technology be welcomed even with its disruptive behavior.

The key distinguishing characteristic of Action Research is that it aims at both improving the subject of the study, and generating knowledge, and achieves both at the same time.

#### Research Methods
Short sections describing other research methodologies.

##### Experimental Research
Rooted in the scientific practice of biologists, physicists, and medical professionals. Variables are manipulated over time usually in controlled environments and associated numeric data is collected. Causal and Correlational models are produced through inferential statistical analysis.

##### Survey Research
Originates from the work of economists and sociologists. Researcher has a considerable sample to analyze, due to questionnaires, surveys, etc. There is little to no control over the environment of the participants.

##### Case Research
A study of one or a small sample of organizations, in depth, but usually doesn't participate in the organization. Seen as an outside perspective. Cases are analyzed either to build or validate models or theories, typically through data collection in structured or unstructured interviews. Particularly useful to dispute models and theories.

#### Action Research Application to HCI
Internet/ web based HCI technologies disrupt current systems and cause change to spread rapidly throughout multiple organizations at a time. Action research has been used to study technology-related issues and how HCI can be used to combat those issues. While there are some cases of action research being used in partnership with HCI and development of new technologies, a vast majority of HCI research has been done with traditional experimental research methodologies.

Action Research in combination with HCI requires a main question or hypothesis to start. An example may be 'Does the use of a video-conferencing suite improve the quality of the outcomes generated by new product development teams whose members are geographically dispersed?'

A research client is the individual, group, or organization whose practical problem (or problems) is supposed to be solved by HCI Action Research. Suggested you start and end an HCI Action Research segment with a survey or questionnaire. This way you can collect data on pre-post technology change views. Additionally, capture observation data and unstructured interview data throughout the process.

Quite often, HCI Action Research defaults to the 'Action Research Cycle' which goes as follows:

   *Hover each step for more detail*

  [Diagnosing (Researcher and Client)](#action-research-application-to-hci "Identification of an improvement opportunity or a general problem to be solved at the client organization.") -->

  [Action Planning (Researcher and Client)](#action-research-application-to-hci "Consideration of alternative courses of action to attain the improvement or solve the problem identified.") -->

  [Action Taking (Researcher and Client)](#action-research-application-to-hci "Selection and Implemenetation of one of the courses of action considered in the previous stage.") -->

  [Evaluating (Researcher and Client)](#action-research-application-to-hci "Study of the outcomes of the selected course of action.") -->

  [Specifying Learning (Researcher)](#action-research-application-to-hci "Reviewing the outcomes of the evaluating stage and, based on this, knowledge building in the form of a model describing the situation under study.") --> ...

A strength of Action Research comes from the observation that is exposes the researcher to much greater quantities of data (while relatively sparse) than more focused research approaches. With theories that, a large body of data whose analysis does not uncover evidence that contradicts a hypothesis, is in fact 'evidence' in support of the hypothesis.

### HCI and Action Research
[HCI Article](http://www.gillianhayes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/J13-ActionResearchTOCHI.pdf)
*Read: 13 June 2017*

      Due to many topics being covered by other articles I will be taking sparser notes on this article. It is still valuable to look back on if need be.

#### Sections
1. [Research Questions](#research-questions)
2. [Action and Intervention](#action-and-intervention)
3. [Evaluation](#evaluation)
4. [Discussion](#discussion)

#### Research Questions
Formulating a problem statement at the start of scientific research projects is standard. In AR, research questions and problem statements should be developed collaboratively with the client, organization, or community you are interacting with.

Engaging with the partner and creating vision and operational statements for future usage and better mutual understandings. Vision statements allow the entire team to work together to decide what the issues are and how all the concerns of the people involved will be accounted throughout the process. Operational statements follow from vision statements and specifically detail how all of the individuals involved will work together to ensure that the vision statements can be met. As a researcher, a primary objective of this statement(s) should be to maximize collaboration between groups in the organization of study.

#### Action and Intervention
Action Research can be targeted at a variety of social and technological changes. In HCI, AR and engagement with new technologies, can be related to participatory design. AR and PD both stem from the idea that 'change should be designed and implemented democratically and inclusively.'

Broad scope projects involving multiple sections of an organization are welcomed as they often produce solutions that ensure attention and care to the needs of all parts of the organization.

#### Evaluation
Evaluation much like project definition, is value-laden. Meaning, all stakeholders and parties involved should evaluate in the success or failure of AR. Stakeholder groups are encourages to place all of their concerns on the table for consideration, review all of the collected data about the project, resolve all of the concerns they can, and prioritize a list of unresolved items.

These methods often lead to disagreement in some projects, and from a research and academia perspective, the pressure to publish is a constant drain on the process. However you must be careful not to model a monopoly and as this will only lead to more unrest between parties.

The results of AR may not be immediately useful to other HCI and outside researchers. But to the participants of the study and similar organizations, it will be directly useful. Including them into the evaluation process promotes more open language and a clearer understanding of their views about the project.

#### Discussion
HCI research strongly supports iterative design practices which is why we so commonly see iterative and cyclical AR design. We must not forget however that this is not just software development, or UX design. The end goal and main objective of AR is academic in nature. Producing and expanding on a body of knowledge and literature about a specific problem. While other experiments and studies look at a single case or control for environmental factors, AR is focused on application and data collection surrounding a change situation. AR is focused on local solutions to local problems that may be transferred to additional situations of similar context.

### Change Situation
[ASCD Paper](http://www.ascd.org/ASCD/pdf/journals/ed_lead/el_197001_mangione.pdf)
*Read: 12 June 2017*

#### Sub-Sections
1. [Overview](#introduction)
2. [Need Identification and Priorities](#need-identification-and-priorities)
3. [Solutions and Implementation](#solutions-and-implementation)

#### Introduction

Change occurring rapidly and more commonplace in our culture has sparked discussion on how to speak of 'change'. This has lead to some descriptive questions regarding:

1. Who decides when change is indicated?
2. What direction should a specific change take?
3. How extensive should the change be? (For example, should elements in the present system be discarded in total or modified and adapted to the new system)
4. Will the change bring about better systems than those currently in use?

Literature strongly supports the principle that those who are to be affect by a change ought to be involved in the decisions concerning the change. With large numbers of individuals with a vested interest, indirect involvement through peer representation can be employed.

Open communication among all parties to be affected by the change is expected. Communicating on a person-to-person basis should be utilized by those wishing to influence behavior. In establishing change, 'communication and direct involvement maximizes conditions for exchanging ideas, dissemination, and receiving feedback on suggested proposals or plans.

Leadership in a system should be open to suggestions from subordinates when discussing innovation and change in the system. 'The leader who desires to encourage change must seek ways to reward creative suggestions when advanced by their staff.'

#### Need Identification and Priorities
Group 'brainstorming' sessions to gather data and ideas about the needs or different parties to be affected by change. Follow plan:

1. Organize small groups (10 - 15 participants per group).
2. Participants are instructed to share any idea that comes to their mind.
3. No [value judgements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_judgment "an assessment of something as good or bad in terms of one's standards or priorities") are permitted pertaining to any suggestion made.
4. The only questions permitted are those seeking clarification of any idea offered.
5. At this stage, the emphasis is on quantity as opposed to quality of ideas presented.
6. The ideas should be recorded verbatim, if possible, for subsequent analysis.

The quality of the output of a procedure such as 'brainstorming' is obviously contingent upon the insightfulness of the group participants. Every effort should be made to involve as representative a group as possible so that the benefits of varying points of view can be obtained.

Outside consultants made be sought after to understand that data from a third party perspective and focus on the feature data of each sub-set of the system. In the case of education, achievement scores, drop-out rates, student unrest, etc.

Systems are always confronted with the reality of limited resources, both human and material. Consequently, it becomes necessary to establish priorities when improvements in systems are contemplated. A representative priorities planning group can be called upon after need identification has occurred to better codify and categorize the needs presented.

#### Solutions and Implementation
Assuming the need for change has been determined and, further, that there is agreement on the priorities of those needs, the solutions, planning, and implementation will be the next logical steps.

Circulating a list of needs and priorities to all parties affected by change will help elicit suggestions and potential solutions. Additionally, consideration should be given to third party consultation and research.

Once a solutions or multiple solutions are determined to be viable, small scale tryouts should be conducted. However prior to initializing the tryout of a solution, a means for evaluating the system should be established. Goals and objectives should be developed, along with procedures for systematically gathering data as the pilot program progresses.

The results of the program should dictate whether or not a program is worthy of widespread implementation. Discussion and dissemination of gathered data from the pilot program to all parties affected by change should be handled accordingly before considering full scale implementation or retrial. Success or failure should both be discussed to continue the open communication style.

      While this article addresses change situations in an education setting, this topic can be applied to a broader scope. And in the case of Civic Technology, a change situation is most certainly occurring or is about to take place. As more and more technology becomes woven into how individuals interact with governments, their systems and data, and etc. A change from the past, described: 'slow and hard to grasp', to the new technological systems of the present and future will be drastic.
